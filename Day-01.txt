AWS Lambda & Serverless Architecture Bootcamp (Build 5 Apps)

Day-01:
What is Node.js?
Runtime environment for javaScript on the server.

What is Serverless?
No need to provision physical server for your computing need.
You don't need som many bits and pieces required to your business application.

Serverless Architecture.
How Serverless work?
You just write your segregated implementation of API for business use-cases.

These functions are stateless and often run in docker like containers.

Serverless means event driven computing using small independent stateless function 
running inside container in the cloud.

Let's write the Hello World program, using Server Less AWS Lambda and API Gateway services from AWS.

So the first thing you should learn is Amazon API Gateway.
Let's do some practice with this AWS service.

Amazon API Gateway
create, maintain, and secure APIs at any scale

API Gateway
- have following sub parts in service
-- API'Server
-- Custom domain names
-- VPC Links

You can have selection of different type of Amazon API
- HTTP API
- Web Socket API
- REST API
- REST API Private

HTTP API
Build low-latency and cost-effective REST APIs with built-in features such as OIDC and OAuth2, 
and native CORS support.

Works with the following:
Lambda, HTTP backends

//////////////////////////////////
OIDC stands for Open ID Connect, and it is an open authentication protocol that profiles
and extends OAuth 2.0 to add an identity layer.

OIDC allows clients to confirm an end user's identity using authentication by an authorization server.
/////////////////////////////////

WebSocket API
Build a WebSocket API using persistent connections for real-time use cases 
such as chat applications or dashboards.

Works with the following:
Lambda, HTTP, AWS Services

REST API
Develop a rest API where you gain complete control over the request and response along 
with API management capabilities.

Works with the following:
Lambda, HTTP, AWS Services

REST API Private
Create a REST API that is only accessible from within a VPC.
Works with the following:
Lambda, HTTP, AWS Services

Just check the your identity first every time you starting up.

[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-99-167 ~]$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AIDA4CF75JJK7QKDHYC3S",
    "Account": "829331163733",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::829331163733:user/serverless-admin"
